The area is sub-divided diagonally by the main Bristol to London railway line, the A4 Keynsham By-pass and a small stream originating from Scotland Bottom, to the west of Hicks Gate. The underlying strata are pennant sandstone with inter-layered coal seams. The entire area is designated as Green Belt on the local area plan."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/keynsham/ndp/id/dataset/settlement.csv>.
