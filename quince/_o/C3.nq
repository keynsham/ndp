The spoil from the deep cutting to the west was deposited in an area adjacent to the stream running into the Avon from Scotland Bottom. A public footpath runs through this area, which is known locally as the Humpty Dumps. This has provided an adventure playground for generations of Keynsham children. A4 By-Pass - The dual carriageway, which by-passes Keynsham, took two years to complete and was opened in 1966. Durley Lane - a private road providing a roadway to Chandos Lodge, the river moorings and Lock Cottage, the lane gave the people of Keynsham access to the ferry, which until the mid 1950s crossed the river to the Chequers Pub and the road to Hanham. Historically Durley Lane served the adjacent quarries for the carting of stone for building."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/keynsham/ndp/id/dataset/settlement.csv>.
