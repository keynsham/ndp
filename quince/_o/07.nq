The fields to the north of the by-pass are currently used for grazing horses. Little or no grass remains on the field between the railway line and the hill-fort on the ridge above the river. The ground here has been excavated and completely re-contoured to make a motor cycle scramble track. A small part of this field is used by the Severn Project for growing horticultural crops in polytunnels. The residents of the houseboats, moored along the riverbank, have erected a number of sheds on the wooded slope, which runs down to the river. Whilst the field between the by-pass and the edge of the Humpty Dumps is used for grazing, there have been a number of occasions recently when motor cycle scrambling has taken place on this land. The field between the by-pass and the A4175 is divided in two. The western portion, formerly used for cattle grazing, is designated as being used for arboriculture (this site has recently been the subject of an application for exploratory gas drilling). The eastern portion is farmed for crops, especially brassicas."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/keynsham/ndp/id/dataset/settlement.csv>.
