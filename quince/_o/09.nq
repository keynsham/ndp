CHANDOS LODGE, Chandos Lodge - Situated on a promontory above the river and commanding a fine view to the east, Chandos Lodge was built for Sir Thomas Bridges in 1663 as a hunting lodge. The house, which is Grade II listed, retains a number of internal decorative features. When the estate of the Second Duke of Buckingham and Chandos was broken up in 1841, Chandos Lodge became the principal residence for Lodge Farm, which encompassed the greater part of the area in the survey. During World War II some of the farm buildings were used for the manufacture of aircraft parts and a commercial dairy. By the 1980s all of the original farm buildings were given over to industrial and commercial use."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/keynsham/ndp/id/dataset/landscape.csv>.
