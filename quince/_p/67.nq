These ward areas were further sub-divided by the Deputy Town Clerk into 108 individual estate areas in which assessments would be carried out.\n\nAn email call out for assistance in completing the character assessments was made to local community groups, e.g. the History Society, the Civic Society, the Keynsham Rotary and Keynsham Lions, some individual residents, school six formers, Town Councillors, Wards Councillors and Town Council officers and grounds staff."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/keynsham/ndp/id/dataset/settlement.csv/metadata>.
