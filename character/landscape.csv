The house, which is Grade II listed, retains a number of internal decorative features. When the estate of the Second Duke of Buckingham and Chandos was broken up in 1841, Chandos Lodge became the principal residence for Lodge Farm, which encompassed the greater part of the area in the survey. During World War II some of the farm buildings were used for the manufacture of aircraft parts and a commercial dairy.
